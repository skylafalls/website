Yay so um, I managed to self-host my own instance of a git server (in this case [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)) and a file server (in this case [copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty)) for backups.

Why? Cause I was bored. Also I like having control over my own stuff, my git repos and files. So uh yeah.

On the git server I have a couple of repos (mostly just mirrors of the existing ones on github like [the website itself](https://github.com/skylafalls/website.git)), and the file server has a backup of all the songs I downloaded.

Yeah that's it, I think? I don't have much else to say right? Oh I forgot to mention, all of this is running on a 2017 iMac cause, it was a good candidate for this kind of random testing.

Anyways see y'all!
